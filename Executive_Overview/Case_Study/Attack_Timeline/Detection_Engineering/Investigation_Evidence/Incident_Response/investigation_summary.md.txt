# Investigation Summary

Activity: Simulated persistence (T1547.001/T1543.003). Findings: Benign binary in attacker locations; validated via OS (`reg query`, `sc query`). No risk; cleanup: `reg delete ... /f`, `sc delete FakeService`. [file:1]

## Investigation Summary

During routine monitoring, a detection rule flagged scheduled task creation (Event ID 4698) combined with process execution (Sysmon Event ID 1). Initial results showed repeated PowerShell executions by the Splunk Universal Forwarder service. Upon analysis, this activity was classified as benign operational noise. Detection logic was refined to suppress known trusted processes while maintaining coverage for malicious persistence attempts.

Persistence-related registry and service activity was detected and analyzed. Despite initial indicators aligning with attacker techniques, further validation confirmed all activity was legitimate and expected.

No containment or remediation actions were required.

### SOC Decision Statement

Based on validation results, the incident was closed as benign activity. No containment or eradication actions were required.
